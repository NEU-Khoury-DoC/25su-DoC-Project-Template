# Consensus

Economic policy is often black-boxed. Our web app, Consensus, aims to streamline the communication, evaluation and discussion of economic policy by connecting citizens, politicians and economists on one platform. Politicians can post their policy proposals, which appear on the feeds of all users. Users can upvote or downvote these posts, politicians and economists can endorse them, economists can give their analysis, and citizens can ask questions. Our data playground feature enhances analysis by using machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Deep Neural Networks to predict a policy's effect on unemployment and inequality.
